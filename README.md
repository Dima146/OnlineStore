# OnlineStore-Epam-Project
**Final EPAM project**

Online store system. The administrator maintains a catalogue of goods. The customer makes orders and pays for them. On the site one can see the contact information of the online store, a catalogue of goods and change the language(EN or RU). The user can log in to an account or register a new one.

After **logging in**, there are available the following functions: viewing user profile, adding products to user's cart and removing them from it, making and viewing an order.
The **administrator** can add new products or change information about them. Also, the administrator can view all active user's orders (he can makes his order too) with their information as well as complete or cancel them.
